# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This is a simple Python project where I implemented Pascal’s Triangle.

## What I Did

I wrote a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists representing the first `n` rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

- If `n <= 0`, it returns an empty list.
- Each row starts and ends with 1.
- Every inner number is the sum of the two numbers above it.

## Example

For `n = 5`, the output is:
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

## How I Tested

I used a test file `0-main.py` to print and check the triangle output.

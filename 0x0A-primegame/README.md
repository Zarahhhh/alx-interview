# 0x0A. Prime Game

This project is about simulating a prime number-based turn-taking game between two players, Maria and Ben.

## How the game works:
- A list of numbers from 1 to n is created for each round.
- Players take turns removing a prime and its multiples.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Maria always starts.
- The goal is to determine the winner after x rounds.

## Files
- `0-prime_game.py`: Contains the game logic.
- `main_0.py`: Used to test the function.

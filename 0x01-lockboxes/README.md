# 0x01. Lockboxes

## üìö Description

This project is part of the ALX Interview preparation series. It focuses on algorithmic problem solving using Python.

You are given `n` number of locked boxes, each numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each box may contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened, starting from box 0 which is initially unlocked.
